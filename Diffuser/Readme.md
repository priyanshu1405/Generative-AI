<h1>Generative AI</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Generative AI repository! This project focuses on the implementation and exploration of diffusion models for image generation. The repository includes a comprehensive explanation and theoretical insights into diffusion models and their application in generative AI.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Diffusion models are a class of generative models that generate data by reversing a gradual noise process. They have gained prominence due to their ability to produce high-quality, complex images. This repository details the implementation of a diffusion model using a UNet-based architecture, trained on a dataset of butterfly images.</p>

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>

<h3>Diffusion Models</h3>
<p>Diffusion models generate data by simulating the reverse of a diffusion process, which gradually adds noise to the data. The key idea is to learn how to reverse this noising process, starting from pure noise and iteratively refining it to produce realistic data.</p>

<h3>UNet Architecture</h3>
<p>The UNet architecture is a type of convolutional neural network designed for image generation tasks. It consists of an encoder that downsamples the input image and a decoder that upsamples it back to the original resolution. Skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers help retain spatial information, crucial for generating high-quality images.</p>

<h3>Training Process</h3>
<p>Training a diffusion model involves two main steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Forward Diffusion Process</strong>: Noise is gradually added to the training images over a series of time steps, creating noisy versions of the images.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Diffusion Process</strong>: The model is trained to reverse the noise process, starting from pure noise and gradually denoising it to recover the original image.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>The dataset used in this project is a collection of butterfly images from the Smithsonian Institution. These images provide a diverse set of patterns and textures, making them suitable for training a generative model.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The trained diffusion model can generate high-quality images that resemble the butterfly images in the training dataset. These results demonstrate the model's ability to learn complex patterns and generate realistic images through the reverse diffusion process.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project showcases the power and versatility of diffusion models in generative AI. By leveraging a UNet-based architecture and a well-curated dataset, the model can generate impressive images, highlighting the potential of diffusion models in various applications.</p>
